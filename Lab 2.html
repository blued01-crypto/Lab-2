        <h2>Web Development Basics</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>1. What is HTTP?</strong><br />
            <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> is a protocol that allows web browsers and servers to
            communicate. Itâ€™s the foundation of data exchange on the web.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2. What is HTML?</strong><br />
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. To create the structure and content of web
            pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>3. How does a browser request a web page?</strong><br />
            When you type a URL into your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the web server. The server then responds
            by sending the HTML file back, which the browser displays.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. Difference between regular and empty tags?</strong><br />
            Regular tags have an opening and closing part like <code>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</code>. Empty tags do not
            have content and are self-closing, like <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5. What is white space collapsing?</strong><br />
            White space collapsing means that multiple spaces, tabs, or line breaks in HTML are treated as a single
            space when rendered by the browser.
